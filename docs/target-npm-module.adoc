There is an additional target that is intended to help you use `shadow-cljs` as *part* of
a project and provide seamless integration with existing JS tools (eg. webpack, browserify, babel,
create-react-app, ...) with as little configuration as possible.

It can be configured like other targets, but since it is meant to work in the JS ecosystem it
comes with a convenience mode that makes such integration easier.

== Convenience Mode

This target is meant to be as easy to access as possible, and does not actually require a specific build in the config. You still need a non-empty config file, but the default one from `shadow-cljs init` will do.

ClojureScript organizes files into namespaces which means that a `demo.foo` namespace should be inside a `src/main/demo/foo.cljs` file. Where `src/main` is the default source path the shadow-cljs tool (see <<Configuration, main configuration>>).


.Sample source for `src/main/demo/foo.cljs`
```
(ns demo.foo)

(defn hello [who]
  (str "Hello, " who "!"))
```

you can compile it (and any others) via:

```bash
$ shadow-cljs compile npm
[:npm] Build completed. (16 files, 5 compiled, 0 warnings, 7.91s)
```

The generated exports will be named `shadow-cljs/` with the CLJS namespace.

```js
$ node
> var x = require("shadow-cljs/demo.foo");
undefined
> x.hello("JS")
'Hello, JS!'
```

Watching with incremental compile is as simple as running `shadow-cljs watch npm`.

== Explicit Configuration

You can also treat `:npm-module` on the same footing with your other builds: give it explicit
configuration. This allows you to also customize the code generation options. Of course
you will configure the <<Configuration, main configuration>> as in all targets. The target-specific
options are:

[horizontal]
`:target`:: Use :npm-module
`:output-dir`:: The path for supporting files in development mode.
`:entries`:: (optional) A vector of namespaces to include. Everything from these will be included.
Defaults to everything it can find.


If you use an `:output-dir` like `"node_modules/shadow-cljs"` you can access them by using `require("shadow-cljs/demo.foo")`. When using something not in `node_modules` you must include them using a relative path. With `:output-dir "out"` that would be `require("./out/demo.foo")` from your project root.

If you plan to distribute code on NPM, then you may want to use the <<NodeLibrary, `:node-library` target>> instead since it allows for a finer level of control over exports and optimization.

== Working with Optimizations

Unlike the `:node-library` target, the module target does not know what you want to call the
symbols you're exporting, so it just exports them as-is. If you use advanced compilation, then everything
will get a minified munged name!

This is easy to remedy, simply add `:export` metadata on any symbols that you want to preserve:

```
(def ^:export my-constant 5.662)
(defn ^:export my-function [] ...)
```

This is a standard annotation that is understood by ClojureScript and prevents Google Closure from
renaming an artifact.
